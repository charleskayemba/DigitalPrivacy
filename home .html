1. INTRODUCTION
</p>
<p>
We are currently living in the so-called information age which can be described as an era where economic activities are mainly information based. 
This is due to the development and use of technology. The main characteristics of this era can be summarized as a rise in the number of knowledge workers,
 a world that has become more open - in the sense of communication (global village/Gutenberg galaxy) and internationalization (trans-border flow of data).
This paradigm shift brings new ethical and juridical problems which are mainly related to issues such as the right of access to information,
 the right of privacy which is threatened by the emphasis on the free flow of information, and the protection of the economic interest of the owners of intellectual property.

In this  document the ethical questions related to the right to privacy of the individual which is threatened by the use of technology will be discussed.
 Specific attention will be given to the challenges these ethical problems pose to the information professional. A number of practical guidelines, based on ethical norms will be laid down.

 </p>
<p> 2.DIGITAL PRIVACY</p>
<p> 
Digital privacy refers to the protection of an individual's information that is used or created while using the Internet on a computer or personal device.
Privacy can be defined as an individual condition of life characterized by exclusion from publicity. </p>
<p> •	Privacy is an important right because it is a necessary condition for other rights such as freedom and personal autonomy. There is thus a relationship between privacy,
 freedom and human dignity. Respecting a person's privacy is to acknowledge such a person's right to freedom and to recognize that individual as an autonomous
human being. </p>
<p> •	However, privacy is not an absolute duty that does not allow for exceptions.in some cases like police cases the police has to encroach on the criminal’s privacy to
 help bring out justice to others.</p>

<p>3. DIFFERENT CATEGORIES OF PRIVATE INFORMATION </p>
<p> Based on the juridical definition of privacy, two important aspects which are of specific relevance for the information profession must be emphasized. The first is the fact that privacy as a concept is closely related to information - in terms of the definition of Neethling (1996, p. 35) privacy refers to the entirety of facts and information which is applicable to a person in a state of isolation. The fact that privacy is expressed by means of information, implies that it is possible to distinguish different categories of privacy namely, private communications, information which relates to the privacy of a person's body, other personal information, and
information with regard to a person's possessions. Each of these categories will be briefly dealt with.
 </p>
<p>  	+ Private communications.</p>
<p> This category of privacy concerns all forms of personal communication which a person wishes to keep private. The information exchanged during a reference interview between the user and the information professional can be seen as an example.
Private communications are good but are also bad because they can be taken advantage of to carry out crimes like murder, theft and so on.
  </p>
<p>  + Privacy of the body  </p>
<p>  	This normally refers to medical information and enjoys
separate legal protection. According to this legislation a person has the right to be
informed about the nature of an illness as well as the implications thereof. Such a person further has the right
to privacy about the nature of the illness and cannot be forced to make it known to others. The only exception
is when the health, and possibly the lives of others may be endangered by the specific illness - such as the
case may be where a person is HIV positive and the chance exists that other people may contract the virus.3
This category of information is of specific importance for an information professional working in a medical
library.
  </p>
<p>  +	Personal information. </p>
<p>  	Personal information refers to those categories of information which refer to only
that specific person, for example bibliographic (name, address) and financial information. This type of
information is of relevance to all categories of information professionals.
 </p>
<p>  +	Information about one's possessions. </p>
<p>  	This information is closely related to property right. According to this
a person does have control over the information which relates to personal possessions in certain instances. For
example, a person may keep private the information about the place where a wallet is kept.

<p> 4 .VIOLATIONS OF PRIVACY  </p>
<p> a. Search and Seizure of Digital Property </p>
<p> Governments and militant organizations utilize internet censorship to shape the public's beliefs and curb dissent. From the most developed countries to the least, examples are prevalent of bloggers, activists, and political opponents being harassed and silenced [1]. In the name of internet security, users are analyzed for characteristics that predict problematic behaviors. Data is saved, which can be used to profile individuals or groups who appear rebellious. During major protest movements around the world, such as the Arab Spring, Occupy protests, and the Umbrella Movement, governments were able to extract data from mobile phone users. Social media and other online correspondence were routinely blocked or tracked to dissuade protesters. While laws exist in most nations to protect search and seizure of physical property, such laws often do not abide for digital property. As a result, without a search warrant, it becomes permissible to insist that individuals forfeit access to social media accounts to gain services such as a visa to visit another country. Repressive regimes scrutinize specific individuals as a method of discrimination.</p>
<p> b. Profiling of Marginalized Groups  </p>
<p> Police in the modern age can target specific ethnic, gender, and age groups. The Chicago police department implemented a "Strategic Subject List", which predicts potential perpetrators and victims of gun violence [2]. Individuals can be intimidated or arrested based on characteristics about them or those they associate with. There is a dangerous potential for big data mining to be used to repress minorities. Online profiling enables police to invade the digital property of strategic subjects [3]. These policing practices broaden disproportionate incarceration of marginalized groups. China has started a "Police Cloud", which appears capable of tracking social and ethnic groups [4]. Not only the police profile marginalized groups, legal and illegal organizations do so as well. Some of them aim to exploit, such as by luring women into prostitution rings or refugees into forced labor. Disadvantaged groups are easy targets of financial scams and more easily taken advantage of.  </p>
<p> c. Biometric Dangers </p>
<p> We have an overarching concern for the fate of the free world in a computer, cloud-driven society that preserves biometric data. Such data will develop the capability to penalize vast amounts of the population for minor infractions, especially those that lack the technological and financial means to protect their privacy. The discrimination of Nazi Germany reminds us how dangerous it can be 
for countries to collect registries that track minorities. Biometric data is a centralized command that pretends to have complete control, but in reality unlocks a door for data to be hacked and abused. In Brazil it is now obligatory to be included in the biometrical database, which also enables voting in elections [5]. In an example of how biometric data is abused, the Brazilian Federal Police in 2017 made a deal with the Electoral Court for sharing this database without announcing the practice previously [6]. 
 </p>
<p>d. Censorship  </p>
<p>d. It was more difficult for autocracies to track down and burn books than it is for modern governments to remove content from the internet. In Turkey, China, and many other countries the internet is censored to such a point that self-censorship takes place. Individuals willing to express themselves online are exposed to reciprocity. In most countries, some level of censorship exists. In Israel a bill was introduced recently that would provide the court with automatic access to remove content from online platforms [7]. Such actions are justified as a defense against conflicts with organizations such as Hezbollah in Lebanon that use internet platforms to initiate violent actions and recruit agents among Arabs who hold Israeli citizenship [8]. However, the Israel Democracy Institute (IDI) argued against the law, as it is liable to create disproportionate censorship in an improper legal process that has no precedent in other countries [9]. Governments attempt to restrict social media, but companies themselves also censor content. The internal rules of such censoring also deserve oversight [10].   </p>
<p>e. Business Surveillance  </p>
<p>Facebook today has over two billion users. It enables people to share private data about themselves with others they know and trust. The company protects a large amount of user data. However, owing to unclear consent and sharing of data with third-party applications, many have discovered that detailed information about them, such as contacts, phone numbers, and likes, was being collected and shared without their consent or awareness [11]. Furthermore, Facebook provided administrative staff controls to erase messages, while users do not have the same controls over their own information [12]. Facebook is not alone in being accused of violating users' privacy. Agencies such as Equifax, which collected credit ratings for millions of people allowed its systems to be breached. Health insurance companies purchase big data from health care facilities to create predictive formulas for identifying risk pools and determining rates [13]. More and more businesses are utilizing big data for customer analytics. The USA, once a leader of restricting invasions of privacy, adopted regulations in 2017 that will remove the tradition of net neutrality. The ramifications of this decision will reduce freedom of expression [14] and increase the power of big data businesses to conduct mass surveillance and sell information about users' viewing content, purchases, and other personal information. Google and other large internet search sites already engage in such practices. They sell our information to advertisers, insurers, and lobbying groups, crafting the world that we are exposed to with almost no external ethical oversight.  </p>
<p>5 .EFFORTS TO PROTECT PRIVACY</p>
<p>	a. Multinational Efforts to Protect Privacy </p>
<p> Despite negative trends in the digital age, the right to privacy is still championed as an ideal by most of us. Multinational collaboration to protect digital rights is on the rise. Nations are bonding together to establish privacy-by-design controls that will protect data according to commonly agreed fundamentals. Governments, businesses, and criminal organizations have profited by invading our privacy, and supranational bodies are a potential buffer- a last line of resistance. The European Union recently adopted the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), which will go into effect in 2018. The regulation demands that individuals retain control of their data, that they can see the information about them that is being collected and ask to remove this information from internet platforms [15]. Organizations that collect data must employ a data protection officer, who will oversee that privacy standards are upheld and personal data of those who request to be forgotten are removed. A variety of multinational organizations aim to protect our digital rights, including the organization that we represent, Pirate Parties International [16]. Multinational initiatives are made possible by member states who participate. The International Conference for Data Protection and Privacy Commissioners (CDPPC), for example, has been bringing together government stakeholders since 1979 to assist them fulfill their mandates [17]. Each member state sends data protection officers to collaborate, which furthers our goal of harmonizing data protection. The present UN Resolution on the Right to Privacy in The Digital Age also exemplifies a positive multinational effort to protect privacy. </p>
<p>b. Government Efforts to Protect Privacy </p>
<p> While governments are demonized as infiltrators of our privacy, they are also guarantors of our digital rights and can reprimand those who violate them. Legislation that safeguards sensitive data is important, and many countries are struggling to keep pace with innovations in information technology that have expanded the realm of digital rights. Governments must both protect privacy and promote transparency, tasks that may seem at odds with one another but often function in tandem [18]. Governments can ensure that citizens are made aware of private information that is collected about them, as well as displaying information about what it does with that data and its own work. Medical data, for example, is private data that governments often enact legislation to protect. Otherwise, individuals could be discriminated against for employment and insurance. An important question that has been posed on the right to privacy is whether to provide people with access to medical records that show genetic dispositions to disease, as this information may not provide positive assistance when preventative precautions do not exist [19]. Governments must debate the levels of privacy and transparency that are in the best interests of its citizens. Voter rights to privacy are also important in democratic nations, as they guarantee the free choice underlying the spirit of elections. Cybersecurity is also a national responsibility as international conflicts between nation-states often spill over into digital environments. Recent examples of government legislation to provide greater transparency of privacy practices, include the Canadian 
Parliament's Privacy Commisioner's Guidlines for Online Consent [20] and Brazil's "Internet Bill of Rights" [21]. Such legislation often seeks to regulate user consent and establish oversight into the interactions of individuals with internet providers and platforms.
<p>c. Business Efforts to Protect Privacy  </p>
</p>
<p> Effective online businesses realize the importance of customer trust, and they often provide their users with data protection and transparency about how they collect and use data. Single-sign-on frameworks present a challenge and opportunity for protecting individuals' privacy. Users are accused of a "privacy paradox", whereby they are willing to give up their rights to privacy for the sake of convenience but are nonetheless outraged to learn their data was utilized [22]. By allowing users to opt-in, companies are mitigating some privacy invasion, but they must carefully weigh the advantages and disadvantages of trading customer data with external services [23]. Data-driven technology is an important phenomenon, which can assist us in our lives. Standardizing the privacy policies for single-sign-on frameworks helps to ensure that user data is not misused by secondary service providers [24]. Privacy enhancing technologies assist us to protect our data, and such services are often provided free of cost. Facebook, which has already been utilized as a negative example of violating privacy, has also made positive efforts to protect our privacy by allowing users to delete accounts [25] and promising to enable users to also be able to delete specific data in the future [12]. The development of encryption services has also expanded the right to be "out of the system", providing individuals with a digital platform to congregate without fear of government interference. Furthermore, blockchain technology is expanding the right of individuals to establish financial networks that are not government regulated. Efforts by businesses to protect digital privacy must provide mutual benefits for individuals and organizations.
